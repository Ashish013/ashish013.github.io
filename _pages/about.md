Hello, I’m a masters student in CMU SCS, studying AI and NLP. I am passionate about building improved and efficient world models at the intersection of vision and language. In the past, I’ve interned with the [Content Distribution](https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/research-areas/#sec3) team at Sony Research India, the [STARS](https://team.inria.fr/stars/en/research/) Team at INRIA and the AI team at [HyperVerge](https://hyperverge.co/).

My broad interests span Multimodal AI, Vision/Large Language Models (VLM/LLM), and Gen AI. **I’m actively seeking ML Engineer/Researcher internships for Summer 2025**. If you're interested in hiring or want to chat in general, feel free to shoot me an email.
