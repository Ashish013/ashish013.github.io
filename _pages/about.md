I am pursuing my master's at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in AI/NLP. Previously, I interned at the [Content Distribution](https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/research-areas/#sec3) team at Sony Research India, the [STARS](https://team.inria.fr/stars/en/research/) Team at INRIA and the AI team at [HyperVerge](https://hyperverge.co/). My broad research interests are working at the intersection of vision and language to design better world models. I'm particularly interested in making these algorithms to be parameter-efficient and accessible. Apart from academics, I enjoy photography, roller skating and playing the ukulele in my spare time.

**I am currently looking for internships in VLM/LLM and Image generation**. If you're interested in hiring or want to chat in general, shoot me an email.
