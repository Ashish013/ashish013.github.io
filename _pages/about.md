I am a data science and artificial intelligence graduate from [IIIT-NR](https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/). I'm currently working with the [Content Distribution](https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/research-areas/#sec3) team at Sony Research India on efficient video distribution. Previously, I interned at the [STARS](https://team.inria.fr/stars/en/research/) Team at INRIA and the AI team at [HyperVerge](https://hyperverge.co/). My research interests are to leverage video understanding and multimodal learning to design better world models. I'm particularly interested in making these algorithms to be parameter-efficient and applying them to healthcare and robotics. Apart from academics, I enjoy photography, roller skating and playing the ukulele in my spare time.
