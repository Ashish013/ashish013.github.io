I am a data science and artificial intelligence graduate from IIIT-NR. I'm currently working with the Content Distribution team at Sony Research India on efficient video distribution. Previously, I interned at the STARS Team at INRIA and the AI team at HyperVerge. My research interests are video understanding and multimodal learning to improve world models. I'm particularly interested in making these algorithms to be parameter-efficient and applying them to healthcare and robotics. Apart from academics, I enjoy photography, roller skating and playing the ukulele in my spare time.
