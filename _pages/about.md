Hello, I’m an AI master’s student at CMU SCS. I am passionate about building improved and efficient world models at the intersection of vision and language. Most recently, I interned with the IP team at NVIDIA, working on AI Image Codecs with a focus on generative/compression methods using models like VAEs and diffusion models. In the past, I’ve interned with the [Content Distribution](https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/research-areas/#sec3) team at Sony Research India, the [STARS](https://team.inria.fr/stars/en/research/) Team at INRIA and the AI team at [HyperVerge](https://hyperverge.co/).

My broad interests span Computer Vision, Multimodal AI and Vision/Large Language Models (VLM/LLM). **I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities as an ML Engineer/Researcher starting in January 2026**. If you're interested in hiring or want to chat in general, feel free to shoot me an email.
